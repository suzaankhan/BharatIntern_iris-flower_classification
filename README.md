# BharatIntern_iris-flower_classification
This repository showcases my Task no 3 i.e. Iris flower Classification assigned to me during my internship journey at Bharat Intern. The project classifies three classes of iris flower based on sepals and petals length and width.  Support vector algorithm and logistic regression were used where logistic regression excelled at accuracy.
